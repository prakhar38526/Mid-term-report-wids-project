# WiDS Mid-Term Project – Traffic Sign Classifier

## About the Project
This repository contains my mid-term project work done as part of WiDS 5.0.  
The project focused on understanding the basics of Machine Learning and Deep Learning using the example of a traffic sign classification problem, which is an important task in self-driving cars.

The main aim of this project was learning concepts step by step and then seeing how those ideas are actually used while writing code.

## What I Did and Learned


### Week 1: Python Basics
In the first week, the focus was on getting comfortable with Python.

I revised basic Python concepts like variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, loops and functions. I also practiced writing simple programs and understood how recursion works at a basic level. Along with this, we had a brief theoretical introduction to Machine Learning to understand what it is and where it is used.

This week helped me build the programming foundation required for the later weeks.

### Week 2: Machine Learning Concepts and Pandas
In this week, I learned the core ideas behind Machine Learning.

We studied different types of Machine Learning and then focused mainly on **Linear Regression**. I learned about cost functions and gradient descent and how models try to reduce error during training. Neural Networks were introduced conceptually, and I also learned how to use **Pandas** for handling datasets.

This week helped me understand the math and logic behind ML models instead of just treating them as black boxes.

### Week 3: From Theory to Implementation
This week was more practical.

I worked on Google Colab notebooks and implemented the concepts learned earlier in actual code. I trained basic models, tested them, and observed how changes in parameters affected the results. 

#### Assignment – Week 3
As part of Week 3, I completed an assignment focused on implementing machine learning concepts in code. In this assignment, I worked on a Google Colab notebook where I implemented the discussed models and observed how training and testing works in practice. The goal was to understand how theoretical concepts like model training and prediction are actually applied using Python.

### Week 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
In the final week, the focus shifted to image-based models.

I learned about evaluation metrics used in Machine Learning and then studied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I understood why CNNs are especially useful for image classification tasks like traffic sign recognition. Compared to simpler models, CNNs were able to extract features from images more effectively.

#### Assignment – Week 4
The Week 4 assignment was based on Convolutional Neural Networks and image classification. In this assignment, I implemented a CNN model using a Google Colab notebook to classify traffic sign images. I learned how CNN layers help in extracting important features from images and why CNNs perform better for image-based tasks compared to simpler models. This assignment helped me understand the practical working of CNNs and evaluation metrics.

## Experiments and Observations

- Initially tried training the model with fewer epochs, but accuracy
  was unstable.
- Increasing epochs improved performance, but after a point the model
  started overfitting.
- Basic data augmentation helped slightly, but was not explored deeply
  due to time constraints.

## Learning Notes

- Implementing linear regression from scratch helped me understand how
  gradient descent actually updates parameters.
- While working with neural networks, I noticed how sensitive training
  can be to learning rate and initialization.
- For the traffic sign task, CNNs performed better mainly because they
  could automatically extract spatial features from images.
